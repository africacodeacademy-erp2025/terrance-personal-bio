## Early Life

What began as a simple curiosity about computers and mobile apps has evolved into a strong passion for software development. It still amazes me that in high school, I studied business subjects with the dream of becoming an accountant, yet today I find myself in the world of technology at university. Here, I am exploring the immense potential of programming and creating impactful solutions. My curiosity and inspiration are challenged daily, and I couldn't be more driven and fulfilled.

The process of building, learning, and optimizing excites me, and I am always looking to deepen my understanding of new technological concepts.
