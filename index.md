## Journey
### Early Life
What began as a simple curiosity about computers and mobile apps has evolved into a strong passion for software development. It still amazes me that in high school, I studied business subjects with the dream of becoming an accountant, yet today I find myself in the world of technology at university. Here, I am exploring the immense potential of programming and creating impactful solutions. My curiosity and inspiration are challenged daily, and I couldn't be more driven and fulfilled.

The process of building, learning, and optimizing excites me, and I am always looking to deepen my understanding of new technological concepts.

Currently am studying Bsc (Hons) Information Communication Technology at Botswana Accountancy College (BAC), this is where i was introduced to programming in C#, Database Management tools like Oracle and Microsoft SQL server and Computer Networking courses. During the curse of my studying i have also manage to complete online course such as:
- CISCO netacad **CCNA Level 1 Certificate**
- CISCO netacad **CISM IT Fundamentals Certificate**
- FreeCodeCamp **Foundamental C# with Microsoft**
- SkillForAll **JavaScript Essentials 1**

### Goals
- To sharpen both my technical and problem-solving skills so I can become a well-rounded, job-ready software developer.
- I want to build apps that are not just functional, but meaningful—tools that improve everyday life for users in Botswana and beyond.
- I hope to grow in person both as a developer and an individual through gaining soft skills such as good communication and collaboration.
- In the short term, I’m focused on completing the Africa Code Accadeny Residency Program where I hope to master full-stack development using tools industry grade tools, while improving my UI/UX design thinking, debugging techniques, and code optimization.
